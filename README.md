# x1tutor

Brief Project Description:
This app will take in an input of a subject that a student wants to be tutored in. This will be the key for the hashtable which stores the number of tutors available for that given subject. People that can use this app will be students who are interested in getting tutored on a specific subject and want to see the number of tutors available. This will give them an idea of the availability for a tutoring session for that given subject. Current tutors can also use this app to add to the number of tutors in a subject. The owner of this company can remove the number of tutors for a subject.
